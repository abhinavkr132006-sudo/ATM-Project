# Problem Statement

Design and implement a Python-based ATM simulation that allows a user to authenticate using a PIN and perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and viewing a transaction history.

# Scope of the Project

This project will simulate a single-account ATM system with:
- PIN-based authentication (3 attempt limit)
- Menu-driven operations: check balance, withdraw, deposit, view transactions, exit
- In-memory transaction recording
- Input validation and basic error handling

# Target Users

- Students learning programming
- Course evaluators

# High-level Features

- PIN authentication
- Check Balance
- Withdraw Money
- Deposit Money
- Transaction History
